# UAT Environment Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment for the Main Street Migrator application. The UAT environment provides a way to test the application in a controlled setting with mock data.

## Files Created or Modified

### Core UAT Files
- `uat_server.ps1` - PowerShell script that creates a lightweight HTTP server on port 8081
- `start_uat.bat` - Simple batch file to launch the UAT server
- `www_access.bat` - Utility to expose the UAT server to the internet via Cloudflare tunnel
- `uat_config.py` - Configuration settings specific to the UAT environment

### Documentation
- `WWW_ACCESS_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide explaining different methods to expose the application to the internet
- `README.md` - Updated with UAT environment information and project structure changes

### Other Updates
- `commit_changes.bat` - Updated with a relevant commit message

## Features Implemented

### UAT Server
- Runs on port 8081 to avoid conflicts with the development server
- Provides mock API responses for all endpoints
- Serves static files from the `/static` directory
- Shows both local and network access URLs

### WWW Access
- Implements Cloudflare tunneling for temporary internet access
- Provides alternative methods (ngrok, port forwarding, dynamic DNS)
- Includes security considerations and best practices

### Deployment Workflow
- Simple start/stop controls
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy setup for both local and remote testing

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to the Git repository
2. Test the UAT environment from another computer
3. Gather feedback from testers
4. Refine the implementation based on feedback
